      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Most of us know that rapid and evolving technologies greatly effects
         everyone's lives on a daily basis. Some people maybe surprise to
          know that there are many demographic areas that have no clue
           what a website or webpage is and sadly no knowlege of 
           how they are developed. Having come from one of these areas,
            my passion for pursuing technology and finding a way to share
             my knowledge with others has been a rewarding adventure.
      <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
      <p>I live in one of the most technolgically advanced countries in the world specially the United States of America. My family roots span mostly thoughout the south primarily in the states of Louisiana and Texas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Philanthropy!!! Of course, not remotely near the same realms of millionaire/billionaire caliber. My hobbies are centered around engaging in community activites. Most notably, serving as a community taskforce member in successfully petitioning city council to build our community a recreation center.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Project Manager for technology projects</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently considering relocation or commuting options.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The technical skills of a web developer is so wide-range in terms of employment choices, higher salaries, and opportunities to purse other technical careers. My goal is to apply my web developing skills to inspire non-technical individuals to grasp the concepts of website technology and the benefits of websites; assist small ma and pa buisnesses to capitalize and sustain their business by reaching more customers; and to mentor individuals who have family cultrual products or services that can be marketed as a propersous business venture. Acheiving a web developer status will enhances my ability to help make what was viewed as impossible, possible.</p>
